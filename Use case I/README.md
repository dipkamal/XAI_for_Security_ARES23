# Use-case-I: Log anomaly detection 

In this notebook, we demonstrate the application of explanation methods in understanding the black-box model prediction on log anomaly.

This folder contains following files and folder:
- model: It conssits of the trained LSTM model for log anomaly detection. 
- deepLog with quantus.ipynb: This notebook contains quantitative evaluation of anomaly detection model, deeplog, with various explanation methods. 
- deepLog with captum.ipynb: This notebook contains extraction of explanations using different explanation methods.
- deepaid: This folder contains the explanation using DeepAid method. We follow the official repo. [Reference](https://github.com/dongtsi/DeepAID)
